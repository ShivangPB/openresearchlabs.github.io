[International summer school on ecological network analysis](http://psbweb05.psb.ugent.be/conet/econetschool/index.php) in Leuven, Belgium Sep 11-13, 2017. We introduce students at the Master and PhD level to ecological network theory and network inference applied to microbial sequencing data. The course includes research talks on the latest developments in the field. Beyond the educational purposes, we also hope to facilitate scientific exchange between theoretical ecologists and bioinformaticians analyzing large-scale sequencing data sets of microbial communities.
